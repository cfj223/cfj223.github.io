_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](report/report.md)**_

In this repo, I ciphered through dictionaries with positive and negative sentiments as well as created my three own variables to measure the sentiment of S&P 500 firm 10-K's. Using these sentiment variables, I went through the data to find out the correlation between sentiment analysis and stock returns. I conducted a cross-sectional study to find out if positive or negative sentiments within 10-K filings have an effect on returns. With a wide variety of industries within the data sample, it was interesting to see to what extent the sentiment of each companies' 10-K correlated with the cumulative returns of each stock. I wanted to see the true importance of the sentiment of 10-K filings and whether they had a real impact on returns.

_**[Regression Practice](report/regression/regression.md)**_

In analyzing the sales prices of homes from 2006-2008, the data set considered a range of variables, such as year sold, overall quality, and neighborhood. Regression analysis was then used to explore how these variables were correlated with the sales prices of homes. By fitting a model to the data, we were able to estimate the strength and direction of these relationships and gain insights into the factors that influenced home sales prices during this time period.
