_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](report/report.md)**_

In this repo, I ciphered through dictionaries with positive and negative sentiments as well as created my three own variables to measure the sentiment of S&P 500 firm 10-K's. Using these sentiment variables, I went through the data to find out the correlation between sentiment analysis and stock returns. I conducted a cross-sectional study to find out if positive or negative sentiments within 10-K filings have an effect on returns. With a wide variety of industries within the data sample, it was interesting to see to what extent the sentiment of each companies' 10-K correlated with the cumulative returns of each stock. I wanted to see the true importance of the sentiment of 10-K filings and whether they had a real impact on returns.
